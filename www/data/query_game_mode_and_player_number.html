<h2>Output Values</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="output_var"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><use x="0" y="0" width="1" height="1" href="#output_icon"/></svg> Player Count</span> (Integer) - Number of players that tried to enter this game.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="output_var"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><use x="0" y="0" width="1" height="1" href="#output_icon"/></svg> Gameplay Mode</span> (Enumeration) - <code>Test Play</code>, <code>Room Play</code>, or <code>Match Play</code>.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
    <span class="output_var"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><use x="0" y="0" width="1" height="1" href="#output_icon"/></svg> Player Count</span> is the number of players that tried to enter this game.
    If a player attempted to enter the game, but could not load into the game due to network issues,
    they still count for this value.
    If a player quit in the middle of the game, either deliberately or by getting disconnected,
    they still count for this value.
    This value does not change during the course of a game.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="output_var"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><use x="0" y="0" width="1" height="1" href="#output_icon"/></svg> Gameplay Mode</span> is:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>Test Play</code> - if launched from Miliastra editor as Test Play, or Multiplayer Test Play.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>Room Play</code> - if launched from a room.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>Match Play</code> - if launched by going through the match making.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If a player tried to match, but ended up only getting matched alone or just with their own team,
    this still counts as <code>Match Play</code> (TODO: verify).
</p>

<span class="small">
Performance may vary for various reasons.
These numbers are just for giving a sense of rough magnitude.
Performance may differ from profiling in a test play when playing a published stage.
First execution of a node within a node graph execution tend to take a bit longer.
