    Koko's MW Doc is an unofficial documentation for Miliastra Wonderland craftpeople.
    <span class="emphasis">It's currently work-in-progress and only focuses on server nodes for now.</span>
    It is created and maintained by kokokokomi222,
    and you can reach me on the Genshin Impact Creator Front Discord server at <code>kokokokomi222</code>.

<p>
    We provide every minute detail about server nodes
    that official documentation does not cover,
    obtained from dozens of hours of experimentation.
    Read <a href="server_nodes/?node=when_custom_variable_changes" class="node event"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><use x="0" y="0" width="1" height="1" href="#event_icon"/></svg> When Custom Variable Changes</a>
