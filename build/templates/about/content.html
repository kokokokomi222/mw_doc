<h2>Plan</h2>
<p>
    If there is some interest, I will slowly continue to write more documentation.
    Even for just my own sake, it may be worthwhile to have these information written down.
    At the rate I'm going, it will probably take minimum of half a year to come near completion.
    My next priority is player/character related nodes and global timer/timer related nodes.
</p>
<h2>Tech</h2>
<p>
    Because this is a simple static site,
    I just manually wrote everything in raw HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
    There is only ~200 lines of Javascript code, which handles
    search, documentation loading, and showing bigger images when clicked.
</p>
<p>
    The documentation HTML is generated from "markdown".
    I wrote a simple markdown parser in Python for MW Doc markdown variant.
    Other build tasks like templating the HTML files,
    generating placeholder documentation,
    and doing grammar/spell checks
    are also written in Python.
</p>
<p>
    No LLM was used to write any part of the code (I do use it to look things up).
    I think LLM is not helpful even for this kind of tiny prototype weekend projects.
    The quality is just not there.

    I currently do not use any tracking on this site.
    I don't even know how many visits I get.
