# Summary
 This event is triggered when a Node Graph Variable in the current Node Graph changes The previous and current values are Generic. Determine the Generic type to correctly receive events for Node Graph Variables of the corresponding type Vessel-type Node Graph Variables do not provide before-value and after-value Output Parameters

# Output Values
* [output:Event_Source_Entity] (Entity) - The Entity associated with this Node Graph
* [output:Event_Source_GUID] (GUID) - GUID of the Entity associated with this Node Graph
* [output:Variable_Name] (String) - Name of the Variable that was changed
* [output:Pre-Change_Value] (Generic) - The Variable's value before the change
