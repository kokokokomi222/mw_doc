# Summary
 Writes the write value as a binary number to the \[start bit, end bit\] of the target value (also a binary number). The start bit is indexed from 0, and the write length includes both the start and end bits If the binary significant length of the write value (counted from the first 1 from the left) exceeds the write length, the write fails and returns the original value If the write value is negative, it also fails due to exceeding the write length (the first bit of a negative number's binary representation is the sign bit 1)
