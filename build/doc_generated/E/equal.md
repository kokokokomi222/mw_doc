# Summary
 Determines whether two inputs are equal Some Parameter Types have special comparison rules: Floating Point Numbers: Floating Point Numbers are compared using approximate equality. When the difference between two Floating Point Numbers is less than an extremely small value, the two numbers are considered equal. For example: 2.0000001 and 2.0 are considered equal 3D Vector: The x, y, and z components of a 3D Vector are compared using Floating Point approximate equality
