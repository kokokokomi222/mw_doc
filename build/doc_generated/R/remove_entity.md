# Summary
 Removing a specified entity is different from destroying it; there will be no destruction effect, and it will not trigger any logic that would occur after destruction, such as end-of-life behaviors in local projectiles or the dropping of energy orbs from removed creations. Removing an Entity does not trigger the \[On Entity Destroyed\] event, but it can trigger the \[On Entity Removed/Destroyed\] event
