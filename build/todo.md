# TODO
* equal - performance
* data type conversion - float -> string behavior, performance
* query_game_mode_and_player_number - verify match making in release\
* create_entity - what happens at dynamic entity limit

# MINOR NITPICKS
* break loop example should have loop complete running
* remove value from list should remove from middle, not front

# NEXT NODES
## Execution
    * stage related * 3
    * set entity faction
    * player and character related * 10
    * timer related * 4
    * global timer related * 5
## Event
    * when entity faction changes
    * player and character related * 6
    * when timer is triggered
    * when global timer is triggered
## Query
    * entity related * 24
    * get current global timer time
## Operation
    * Bitwise operations * 8

# FEATURES
* input/output in table
* better ordering of math operation nodes
* section link / scroll

# GUIDES - pages for consolidating repeatedly appearing concepts
* error handling (many nodes are no-op. Some raise error but continues)
* three variables - local, node graph, custom
* default value of a type
* container type and reference passing
* removed vs destroyed
* preset status
