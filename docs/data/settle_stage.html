<h1 class="execution"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 1 1" title="Execution Node"><use x="0" y="0" width="1" height="1" href="#execution_icon"/></svg> Settle Stage</h1>
<p>
    Settles the stage.
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
    Settling the stage terminates the gameplay for every player,
    and all players are sent to the results screen that shows
    new achievements, competitive rank changes, scores and rankings of players, etc.
</p>
<p>
    To actually set the results of settlement,
    use "Stage Settlement" execution nodes such as
    <a href="?node=set_player_settlement_success_status" class="node execution"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><use x="0" y="0" width="1" height="1" href="#execution_icon"/></svg> Set Player Settlement Success Status</a> or <a href="?node=set_player_settlement_ranking_value" class="node execution"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><use x="0" y="0" width="1" height="1" href="#execution_icon"/></svg> Set Player Settlement Ranking Value</a>.
</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
    In this example, the player who selected the tab will have their settlement status set to <code>Victory</code>.
    Then we settle the stage, ending the stage immediately.

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        This node removes all players and characters.
        Thus, no settlement result can be set after this node has been executed.
        We recommend that you do not run any logic after this node is called,
        even though it can still run nodes after this node.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>
    In a single player game with all peripheral systems disabled,
    this node took ~1200 units to run on average.
</p>
<span class="small">
Performance may vary for various reasons.
These numbers are just for giving a sense of rough magnitude.
Performance may differ from profiling in a test play when playing a published stage.
First execution of a node within a node graph execution tend to take a bit longer.
