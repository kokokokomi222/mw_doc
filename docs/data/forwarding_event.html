<h1 class="execution"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 1 1" title="Execution Node"><use x="0" y="0" width="1" height="1" href="#execution_icon"/></svg> Forwarding Event</h1>
<p>
    Forwards an event to another entity.
</p>

<h2>Input Parameters</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="input_var"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><use x="0" y="0" width="1" height="1" href="#input_icon"/></svg> Target Entity</span> (Entity) - Target entity where the event is being forwarded to
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
    Forwarded event keeps the same event output values.
    In particular, event source entity (which is present in many events) is the original entity, not the forwarded entity.
    Typically, event source entity is same as self entity.
    But with forwarded event, event source entity may differ from the self entity.
</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
    A timer event is forwarded to another entity with a specific GUID in this example.

</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Forwarded event can be forwarded again. 
        If an event is forwarded back to an entity that forwarded that event (thus making a loop),
        it seems to be a no-op (so it does not crash in an infinite loop).
    </li>
    <li>
        Signal event should not be forwarded
        since it will be already be triggered by the original signal event on the target.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>
    For a timer event, it took ~2 units to run on average.
</p>
<span class="small">
Performance may vary for various reasons.
These numbers are just for giving a sense of rough magnitude.
Performance may differ from profiling in a test play when playing a published stage.
First execution of a node within a node graph execution tend to take a bit longer.
