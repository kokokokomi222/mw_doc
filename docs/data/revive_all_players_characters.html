<h1 class="execution"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 1 1" title="Execution Node"><use x="0" y="0" width="1" height="1" href="#execution_icon"/></svg> Revive All Player's Characters</h1>
<p>
     Revive all character entities of a specified player, but this node is only effective when the player is in a state where all their characters are down. In Beyond Mode, since each player has only one character, this node has the same effect as the "Revive Character" node. In Classic Mode, players can have multiple characters. If only some of the characters are down, this node will not take effect, meaning it will not revive the downed characters.
